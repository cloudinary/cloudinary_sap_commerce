<roles>
    <!--
        The behavior is as follows:

        - by default no <role> elements are present
        - for the Form Builder Summary and New pages, this is equivalent to:
          <role name="*" app="*" form="*"/>
        - for the Form Runner Home page
          - no <role> elements
            - user cannot unpublish/publish any forms
            - user cannot see unavailable forms
          - with <role name="*" app="*" form="*"/>:
            - user can unpublish/publish any forms
            - user sees unavailable forms

        This ensures:

        - that Form Builder is usable out of the box even without setting Form Builder permissions
        - that the Form Runner Home page, which can by default be accessed by any user unless it is explicitly
          protected, does not inadvertently provide access to administrative functions

    Examples:

        Any user can create and administrate any form:
        <role name="*" app="*" form="*"/>

        User with role "orbeon-user" can create and administrate any "acme" forms:
        <role name="orbeon-user" app="acme" form="*"/>
